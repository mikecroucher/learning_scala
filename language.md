Language notes
==============
I don't know Java so all those tutorials that compare scala to Java are lost on me

Comments:
---------

```
// Single line comments

/* Multi-line comments
 * Can be done
*/ As well
```

Line termination
----------------
* Lines are terminated by newline or semicolon. Doesn't matter which.

* Multiple statements on one line are separated by semicolon

```
val message = "foo"; println(message)
```
